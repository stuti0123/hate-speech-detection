# 🛡️ Hate Speech Detection Web App  

A simple **Machine Learning + Streamlit** project that detects **Hate Speech**, **Offensive Language**, and **Neither** from user input text.  
This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment using Streamlit Cloud.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Data Preprocessing (cleaning text, removing stopwords, punctuation, and URLs)  
- ✅ Feature Extraction with **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF**  
- ✅ Logistic Regression model for classification  
- ✅ Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- ✅ Interactive **Streamlit Web App** for predictions

## 📊 Dataset
 Dataset used: Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset

 7 columns (including tweet, class, etc.)

 3 Labels:

     0 → Hate Speech

     1 → Offensive Language

     2 → Neither

---

## 📈 Model Performance
   Accuracy: ~90% with CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression

   TF-IDF also tested, with slightly different performance

   Confusion matrix and classification reports included

---

## ✨ Future Improvements
  - Use Deep Learning models (LSTMs, BERT) for better accuracy

  - Add data visualizations of predictions in the web app

  - Enhance UI/UX with advanced Streamlit components

  - Integrate with APIs for real-time hate speech monitoring

Thank You!
